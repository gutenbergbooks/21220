<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>RIGBY CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p class="note">[We are enabled, by the kindness of their possessor, to lay
before our readers copies of the following characteristic
letters from the well-known Richard Rigby, Esq., who was for so
many years the leader of the Bedford party in the House of
Commons. They were addressed to Robert Fitzgerald, Esq., a
member of the House of Commons in Ireland, and Judge of the
Court of Admiralty in that country.]</p>

<p class='center'><i>Mr. Rigby to Mr. R. Fitzgerald.</i></p>

<p class='right'>Woburn Abbey, Wednesday, 11th Dec., 1765.</p>

<p class='salute'>Dear little Bob,</p>

<p>I am impatient to know if you had resolution enough to attend his
Excellency last Sunday, as I advised, and if you had, what was the
result of the audience....</p>

<p>I arrived here last night, and find the Duke and Duchess, Marquis and
Marchioness, all in perfect health. With my love to the Provost<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, tell
him the chancellorship answers the intention to the utmost of his
desire: we are wonderfully pleased with it. Tell him also that I do not
find the defalcation amongst our friends to be as was represented in
Dublin. Stanley is not, but has refused to be, ambassador to Berlin;
Lord North is not, but has refused to be, vice-treasurer. The parliament
meets on Tuesday: the ministers of the House of Commons, who are to be
rechose, can get nobody who is in Parliament to read the king's speech
for them at the Cockpit the night before. They, I believe, are in a
damned dilemma: how much that makes for us time must show. Cooper is
bribed to be Secretary of the Treasury, by 500<i>l.</i> a-year for his life,
upon the 4-1/2 per cents, in the Leeward Islands, the same that Pitt's
pension is upon. He remains for the present, however, at Bath. Calcraft
will run Cooper hard at Rochester, against both Admiralty and Treasury.
Wish Col. Draper joy for me of his red riband: he will have it next week
with Mitchell, who returns to th<span class='pagenum'><a name="page350" id="page350">{350}</a></span>e King of Prussia. The poor young
prince cannot live. I have time for no more.</p>

<p class='regards'>Adieu, yours ever,</p>
<p class='right'>R. R.</p>
<p class='in2'>I expect to hear fully from you very shortly.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p class='right'>St. James's Place, 1st Feb., 1766.</p>

<p class='salute'>Dear little Bob,</p>

<p>Though you are a little villain for never sending me a word of news from
Sir Lucius Pery, Flood, Lucas, and the rest of the friends to your
enslaved country, yet I will inform you that yesterday, in the House of
Commons, upon a question of no moment, only for fixing a day for the
hearing a contested election, the ministry were run within 11: the
numbers 137 and 148. Twenty rats in the Speaker's chamber, and in all
the cupboards in the neighbourhood. Monday next is the day for deciding
the American question; and do not be surprised if there is an end of the
present ministry in less than a week. As soon as I know who are to be
their successors, you shall hear from me again.</p>

<p>If you are in want of such another patriot to second Lucas, Pitt is at
your service. He seems likely to want a place.</p>

<p class='regards'>Yours ever,</p>
<p class='right'>R. R.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p class='right'>St. James's Place, 14th Nov., 1766.</p>

<p class='salute'>Dear little Bob,</p>

<p>I have not wrote to you this age, nor have I anything very pleasant to
say to you now. Our Parliament is met in a very acquiescing disposition.
The Opposition is sickly, and my great friend, who would naturally give
it most strength and energy, is tired of it as much as he is of the
Court. Lord Chatham seems, by all that has yet appeared, to have adopted
all Grenville's plan of pacific measures; and as he formerly told us he
had borrowed a majority, he seems now to have borrowed a system. The
world has it, that we are joined to the ministry, and, as matters stand,
I wish there was more truth in that report than there is; but I have not
the smallest expectation of a place, I assure you. Tell this or not, as
you like. The Duke of Bedford says he sees no ground to oppose upon: he
disapproves of mere factious opposition; that no good can arise from
such conduct either to ourselves or the public.</p>

<p>I have been at the House only the first day, nor do I know when I shall
go again. I cannot stomach giving my silent approbation to Conway's
measures, be they good or bad. In this damned situation of affairs you
will not expect I should write long letters; but I could not avoid
giving you a hint to let you know the true state of things. Adieu, my
dear friend.</p>

<p class='regards'>Yours ever,</p>
<p class='author'>R. R.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p class='right'>St. James's Place, 2nd May, 1767.</p>

<p class='salute'>Dear Bob,</p>

<p>The East India business is in a way of being settled,&mdash;400,000<i>l.</i> to be
paid by the company for three years, and no addition of term to be given
for their charter. It remains for the General Court of Proprietors to
consent to this next Wednesday, which, if they do, the Parliament will
confirm it on Friday. We had some good warm talk upon it yesterday in
the House. Conway and Beckford and I sparred a good deal, and I am vain
enough to think I did not come off with the worst of it. Conway said,
<i>inter alia</i>, that Lord Chatham's health was too bad to have any
communication of business. The world seems to agree that he is mad, and
his resignation is talked of,&mdash;God knows with what truth. The American
business is next Tuesday. I do not see much prospect of a junction
taking place where I have been labouring for it. We remain upon civil
terms with each other, and no more....</p>

<p>My heart's love to all friends in Dublin: tell them it is every day more
and more my opinion that this Lieutenant never means to set his foot in
that kingdom, and I have good reasons for what I say.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear little fellow.</p>

<p class='regards'>I am ever yours,</p>
<p class='author'>R. R.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p class='right'>St. James's Place, 30th May, 1767.</p>

<p class='salute'>Dear Fitz,</p>

<p>I have received your several letters, and am much obliged to you for
them. I wish I could send you something real in the political way, as
you call it, in return; but there is as little reality as stability in
our politics. Dyson has carried his persecuting bill against the East
India Company through the House of Commons, in spite of the Secretary of
State and Chancellor of the Exchequer, both of whom helped us to make up
a miserable minority of 84 against 151. Charles went at one o'clock in
the morning, when the House was up, to dinner with a set of our friends,
at Sir Lau. Dundass's, and there talked a big language of resigning the
seals the next day. The next day came, and we rallied the majority upon
this state of independence with great success, both Charles himself,
Wedderburn, and I; and he invited himself, Charles I mean, to dine with
us again that day at Lord Gower's. Again the same language of
resignation; but the spirit has subsided since, and we hear no more of
it. If Conway and he will take such usage, the Court will certainly let
them keep their places; for where can it find better tools? The East
India Company pursue the bill, with the council and evidence, to the
House of Lords, where matters run much nearer; for on the same day we
were so beat in the House of Commons, Lord Gower's motions in the House
of Lords, touching America, were rejected only by a majority of<span class='pagenum'><a name="page351" id="page351">{351}</a></span> three,
two of which were the king's brothers. The Duke of York was absent. If we
should succeed in that House, so as to reject this bill, possibly the
ministry may break to pieces; otherwise I rather think it will hobble
lamely on, through the summer, with universal discontent attending it.
Chatham is certainly as ill as ever; and, notwithstanding all reports to
the contrary, Lord Holland has not been sent to by the Court. He is
arrived at his house in Kent, and comes, but of his own accord, to town
to the birthday. On that day, the clerks, Watts, and I go down to
Lynch's for five or six days: I wish you was of the party. It would have
been very kind indeed in Mr. Harvey, the six-clerk, to have tipped so
soon. Your Lord Lieutenant says he is to go. God help the poor man if he
does. I am sorry for your account of the disorders in the college. I do
not like anything that may throw reflexion on Andrews, and I will press
him to come homewards. Adieu, my dear Bob.</p>

<p class='regards'>Most faithfully yours,</p>
<p class='author'>R. R.</p>


<hr class='short' />

<p class='right'>Pay Office, 2nd May, 1769.</p>

<p class='salute'>Dear Bob,</p>

<p>After I wrote to you last Saturday morning, I went to the House, where I
found a petition presented from fifteen tailors or tinkers, freeholders
of Middlesex, against Lutterell. The opposition wanted a call of the
House for Wednesday fortnight. We insisted on hearing it next Monday,
and divided 94 against 49. This business retards the prorogation till
this day or to-morrow se'nnight: but we are adjourned till Monday; so
nothing but hearing this nonsense remains. Wilkes' stock falls very fast
every day, and upon this measure there was such difference of opinion
amongst his friends, that Sawbridge and Townsend would not attend on
Saturday. Serjeant Whitacre has desired to be Lutterell's counsel
gratis, in order to deliver his opinion at the bar of the House on the
legality of Lutterell's seat; and says he shall insist, if the House
should be of opinion that Lutterell is not duly elected, that he himself
is, as having been next upon the poll of those who were capable of
receiving votes.</p>

<p>No news yet of your secretary. Some people are impatient to hear his
report of the state of parties, and their several dispositions to
support government, on your side the water. He must certainly be a most
competent judge, after so long a residence there, and after such open
and frank discourse as every man there would naturally hold with him
upon critical matters. Some better judges than him, lately arrived from
Ireland, make no scruple in declaring there will be a majority of forty
against the Castle at the opening the session. Adieu, my dear little
Bob: my love to the Provost.</p>

<p class='right'>Lawford, Saturday Evening, 4th Nov., 1769.</p>

<p class='salute'>Dear little Bob,</p>

<p>It would be ungrateful in the present company here not to take some
notice of you, just as they had finished the last bottle of an excellent
hogshead of Burgundy, which you sent into my cellar, I believe, seven
years ago. What has come since we will avoid mentioning. A few bottles,
however, of the former were reserved for the divine Charlotte, and she,
and Caswell, and I have this day finished them; and the last glass went
off to your health. Sister Charlotte wishes you public and private
happiness during this bustling winter, and hopes that you are not
determined to forsake the English part of your family for ever. I
received your letter of the 24th here two days ago, and should most
undoubtedly desire you to send me your votes, if I had not already
engaged my old friend at the Secretary's office to do it; but I beg
early intelligence of your parliamentary proceedings, about which I am
very anxious. I do not believe there is the smallest foundation for
believing that Junius is Wedderburn. I had, a few days ago, great reason
to guess at the real Junius: but my intelligence was certainly false;
for sending to inquire in a more particular manner, I discovered the
person hinted at to be dead. He was an obscure man; and so will the real
Junius turn out to be, depend upon it. Are Shannon and Ponsonby and
Lanesborough still stout against Augmentation? or must the friends to
the measure form a plan that they like themselves? A letter from Colonel
Hall, of the 20th regiment, this evening, informs me that General Harvey
is come from Ireland, and is very impatient to see me: if his business
is to consult me upon the utility of this military plan, I am already
fully convinced of it: but nobody knows less than I do how to get it
through your House of Commons,&mdash;I only hope by any means rather than a
message from the king. Perhaps the measure is taken, and I am writing
treason against the understanding of our own ministers. God forbid! but
I do not approve of letting down the dignity and power of the chief
governors of Ireland lower than they are already fallen, to quarrel with
a mountebank at a custard feast. Adieu, my dear little fellow.</p>

<p class='regards'>Yours ever, most sincerely,</p>

<h3>ISTHMUS OF DARIEN.</h3>

<p>As public attention is now much directed to the canal across the Isthmus
of Darien, one end of which is proposed to communicate with the harbour
which was the site of the ill-fated at<span class='pagenum'><a name="page352" id="page352">{352}</a></span>tempt at colonisation by the
Scotch about 150 years ago, the subjoined extract, giving an account of
that harbour, by (apparently) one of the Scotch colonists, may be
interesting to your readers. It is taken from a paper printed in
<i>Miscellanea Curiosa</i>, vol. iii. p. 413., 2nd edit., entitled "Part of a
Journal kept from Scotland to New Caledonia in Darien, with a short
Account of that Country, communicated [to the Royal Society] by Dr.
Wallace, F.R.S.":</p>

<blockquote><p>"The 4th [November] we came into the great harbour of Caledonia.
It is a most excellent one; for it is about a league in length
from N.W. to S.E. It is about half a mile broad at the mouth,
and in some places a mile and more farther in. It is large
enough to contain 500 sail of ships. The greatest part of it is
landlocked, so that it is safe, and cannot be touched by any
wind that can blow the harbour; and the sea makes the land that
lies between them a peninsula. There is a point of the peninsula
at the mouth of the harbour that may be fortified against a
navy. This point secures the harbour, so that no ship can enter
but must be within reach of their guns. It likewise defends half
of the peninsula; for no guns from the other side of the harbour
can touch it, and no ship carrying guns dare enter for the
breastwork at the point. The other side of the peninsula is
either a precipice, or defended against ships by shoals and
breaches, so that there remains only the narrow neck that is
naturally fortified; and if thirty leagues of a wilderness will
not do that, it may be artificially fortified in twenty ways. In
short, it may be made impregnable; and there are bounds enough
within it, if it were all cultivated, to afford 10,000 hogsheads
of sugar every year. The soil is rich, the air good and
temperate; the water is sweet, and every thing contributes to
make it healthful and convenient."</p></blockquote>

<h3>NOTES ON SEVERAL MISUNDERSTOOD WORDS.</h3>

<p><i>Mechal</i> is from the mint of Thomas Heywood; but, like many other words
of the same stamp, it continued a private token of the party who issued
it, and never, as far as I am aware, became current coin. Four times, at
least, it occurs in his works; and always in that sense only which its
etymon indicates, to wit, "adulterous." In his "Challenge for Beauty:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">"... her own tongue</p>
<p class="i0">Hath publish'd her a <i>mechall</i> prostitute."</p>
<p class="i1">Dilke's <i>Old English Plays</i>, vol. vi. p. 421.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In his "Rape of Lucrece:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i5">"... that done, straight murder<br /></p>
<p class="i0">One of thy basest grooms, and lay you both</p>
<p class="i0">Grasp'd arm in arm in thy adulterate bed,</p>
<p class="i0">Men call in witness of that <i>mechall</i> sin."</p>
<p class="i5"><i>Old English Drama</i>, vol. i. p. 71.</p>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;where the editor's note is&mdash;"probably derived from the French word
<i>m&eacute;chant</i>, wicked." In his "English Traveller:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i5">"... Yet whore you may;</p>
<p class="i0">And that's no breach of any vow to heaven:</p>
<p class="i0">Pollute the nuptial bed with <i>michall</i> sin."</p>
<p class="i2">Dilke's <i>Old English Plays</i>, vol. i. p. 161.</p>
</div></div>

<p>This misprint the editor corrects to <i>mickle</i>: professing, however, as
he well might, distrust of his amendment. Nares discards Dilke's guess,
and says, "If a right reading, it must be derived from <i>mich</i>, truant,
adulterous." Whereby to correct one error he commits another, assigning
to <i>mich</i> a sense that it never bears. If haply any doubt should remain
as to what the true reading in the above passage is, a reference to
Heywood's <i>Various History concerninge Women</i> will at once assoil it. In
that part of his fourth book which treats of adulteresses (p. 195.),
reciting the very story on which his play was founded, and calling it "a
moderne historie lately happening, and in mine owne knowledge," he
continues his narrative thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>"With this purpose, stealing, softly vp the stayres, and
listening at the doore, before hee would presume to knocke, hee
might heare a soft whispering, which sometimes growing lowder,
hee might plainely distinguish two voyces (hers, and that
gentleman's his supposed friend, whom the maide had before
nominated), where hee might euidently vnderstand more than
protestations passe betwixt them, namely, the <i>mechall</i> sinne
itselfe."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Halliwell, in his compilation of <i>Archaic and Provincial Words</i>,
gives <i>Mechall</i>, wicked, adulterous, with a note of admiration at
Dilke's conjecture; and a reference to Nares, in v. <i>Michall</i>. Mr. H.
neither adduces any authority for his first sense, "wicked," nor can
adduce one.</p>

<p><i>To lowt</i>, to mock or contemn. A verb of very common occurrence, but, as
might be expected, quite unknown to the commentators on Shakspeare,
though its meaning was guessed from the context. As it would be tedious
and unnecessary to write all the instances that occur, let the following
suffice:</p>

<p>Where I would note, by the way, that in three copies of the folio 1632,
now by me, it is printed "<i>at</i> traitor," although two of these folios
have different title-pages; that which appears to be the later
impression bears under the portrait these words: "London, printed by
Thos. Cotes, for Robert Allot, and are to be sold <i>at his shop</i> at the
signe of the Blacke Beare, in Paul's Church-yard, 1632." The other wants
the words "at his shop," as described in <span class="smcap">Mr. Collier's</span> edition.</p>

<p>The mention of <span class="smcap">Mr. Collier's</span> name is a hint that reminds me to
advertise him of a mistake he lies under, in supposing that the Duke of
Devonshire's copy of the Play of <i>King Richard II.</i> in 4to., dated 1605,
is unique (<i>vid.</i> Collier's <i>Shakspeare</i>, vol. iv. p. 105.,
Introduction); as there is another in the Philosophical Institute at
Hereford, presented by the late Edward Evans, Esq., of Eyton Hall, in
the same county.</p>

<p>But to return. Mr. Halliwell, in his work above quoted, furnishes
another instance of the verb <i>lowt</i>, from Hall's <i>History of King Henry
IV.</i>, which the reader may consult for himself. I will merely add, that
the interpretation there propounded is plausible but unsound, the
context only giving aim to his conjecture.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

<p><i>Drills presaging Death.</i>&mdash;In Norfolk, agricultural labourers generally
believe that if a drill go from one end of a field to the other without
depositing any seed&mdash;an accident which may result from the tubes and
coulters clogging with earth&mdash;some person connected with the farm will
die before the year expires, or before the crop then sown is reaped. It
is a useful superstition, as it causes much attention to be paid to make
the drill perform its work correctly. Still it is remarkable that such a
superstition should have arisen, considering the recent introduction of
that machine into general use. I should be glad to learn from other
readers of "N. &amp; Q." whether this belief prevails in other parts of
England where the drill is generally used.</p>

<p class='author'>E. G. R.</p>


<p><i>Beltane in Devonshire.</i>&mdash;Seeing that the ancient superstition of the
Beltane fire is still preserved in Scotland, and is lighted on the 1st
of May, the origin of which is supposed to be an annual sacrifice to
Baal, I am induced to state that a custom, evidently derived from the
same source, is, or was a few years since, annually observed in the wild
parts of Devonshire. At the village of Holne, situated on one of the
Spurs of Dartmoor, is a field of about two acres, the property of the
parish, and called the Ploy (<i>Play</i>) Field. In the centre of this stands
a granite pillar (Menhir) six or seven feet high. On May morning, before
daybreak, the young men of the village assemble there, and then proceed
to the Moor, where they select a ram lamb (doubtless with the consent of
the owner), and after running it down, bring it in triumph to the Ploy
Field, fasten it to the pillar, cut its throat, and then roast it whole,
skin, wool, &amp;c. At midday a struggle takes place, at the risk of cut
hands, for a slice, it being supposed to confer luck for the ensuing
year on the fortunate devourer. As an act of gallantry, in high esteem
among the females, the young men sometimes fight their way through the
crowd to get a slice for their chosen amongst the young women, all of
whom, in their best dresses, attend the <i>Ram Feast</i>, as it is called.
Dancing, wrestling, and other games, assisted by copious libations of
cider during the afternoon, prolong the festivity till nightfall.</p>

<p>The time, the place (looking east), the mystic pillar, and the ram,
surely bear some evidence in favour of the Ram Feast being a sacrifice
to Baal.</p>

<p><i>Touching for King's Evil.</i>&mdash;The following passage bearing upon the
custom of touching for the King's Evil, and its antiquity, is extracted
from Laing's translation of Snorro Sturleson's <i>Heimskringla</i>. King Olaf
the Rich, afterwards Saint, had fled to Russia on being driven out of
his king<span class='pagenum'><a name="page354" id="page354">{354}</a></span>dom by Knut the Great. Ingigerd, Queen of Russia, desired a
widow to take her son, who "had a sore boil upon his neck," to King
Olaf, "the best physician here, and beg him to lay his hands on thy
lad." The king was unwilling to do so, saying that he was not a
physician; but at last consented:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Then the king took the lad, laid his hands upon his neck, and
felt the boil for a long time, until the boy made a very wry
face. Then the king took a piece of bread, laid it in the figure
of the cross upon the palm of his hand, and put it into the
boy's mouth. He swallowed it down, and from that time all the
soreness left his neck, and in a few days he was quite well....
Then first came Olaf into the repute of having as much healing
power in his hands as is ascribed to men who have been gifted by
nature with healing by the touch."</p></blockquote>

<p>Laing asks in a note:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Is the touching for the King's Evil ... connected with this
royal saint's healing by the touch?"&mdash;<i>The Heimskringla</i>, vol.
ii. p. 297., 8vo.: London, 1844.</p></blockquote>

<h3>GAFFER OR GAMMER, ETC.</h3>

<p>These two venerable words were used by our ancestors. Every one has
heard of Gammer Gurton; Gaffer Gingerbread was also famous in, as well
as I can remember, a portion of the literature which amused my
childhood. In <i>Joseph Andrews</i>, Fielding styles the father of Pamela
"Gaffer Andrews:" and, for aught I know, the word may be still in use in
Wilts and Somerset.</p>

<p>Unde derivantur <i>Gaffer</i> and <i>Gammer</i>? Lye said they were <i>quasi</i>
good-father and good-mother; Somner, that they were the Anglo-Saxon
<i>Gef&aelig;der</i> and <i>Gemeder</i>, i. e. godfather and godmother; Webster derives
the former from the Hebrew <i>geber</i>, man, the latter from the
Scandinavian <i>gamel</i>, old. Having a fondness for simplicity, I go less
learnedly to work. I have observed little children, when commencing to
speak, to say "ganpa" and "gamma" for grandpapa and grandmamma: whence I
conjecture that, in the olden time, ere we had Pa's and Ma's, the little
aspirants used to say "ganfa'er" and "gamma'er," which easily became
<i>Gaffer</i> and <i>Gammer</i>. I am confirmed in this view by a friend to whom I
mentioned it, and who told me that his own children always called his
father <i>gaffer</i>, a word entirely of their own formation.</p>

<p>There is a term now coming a little into use, which is I believe of pure
Irish origin, namely, <i>old fogie</i>. Indeed, I have heard it used rather
disrespectfully of those mature old warriors, whom it pleases the wisdom
of our government to send out in the command of our fleets and armies.
The word, as I said, is of Irish, or rather of Dublin birth. The <i>old
fogies</i> are the inmates of the Royal or Old Men's Hospital, the Irish
Chelsea. I think, then, that it must be plain to every one that the term
is nothing more than a good-humoured corruption or diminutive of <i>old
folks</i>.</p>

<p>This leads me to the simple origin of a word which seems to have posed
all our etymologists&mdash;it has done so to Richardson at least&mdash;namely,
"<span class="smcap">Pettifogger</span>, a low, tricky attorney." According to my view,
<i>pettifogger</i> is neither more nor less than <i>pettifolker</i>, i. e. one
whose practice lies among the <i>petty folk</i>, small tradesmen,
day-labourers, and such like. This derivation, too, has simplicity in
its favour.</p>

<h3>Minor Notes.</h3>

<p><i>Search for MSS.</i>&mdash;A proposal was made some time ago in "N. &amp; Q." by
<span class="smcap">Mr. Mackenzie</span>, that some systematic effort should be made for
the recovery of ancient MSS. I have heard nothing more of it, but am
sure that, if a beginning were made, it would receive warm support from
the friends of literature. There is, however, a kindred search which can
be prosecuted nearer home, with more certain success and more important
results. I mean a continued search among the numerous MSS. in which so
much of our unknown history is buried. Might not a systematic
examination of these be instituted, with the help of the "division of
labour" principle, so that important portions of the great mass should
be accurately described and indexed, valuable papers abridged for
publication, and thus given to the world entire? Much is being done, no
doubt, here and there; but surely much more would be accomplished by
united and systematised labour. How much light might be thrown on a
given period of our history by such a study of all the records,
correspondence, &amp;c. relating to it. Is there none of our existing
societies within whose scope such an undertaking would fall, or might
not different societies unite for the purpose? The books, of course,
should be sold to the public. I leave the hint to the judgment of your
readers.</p>

<p>The names of his wives are not mentioned. The details of births,

Zachary Clifton was at the Universities of Utrecht and Leyden (at which

in 1659 was ordained minister of the gospel at Wisborough Green in
Sussex. Many other particulars are given. The Bible is in the library of

<p><i>The Three per Cent. Consols.</i>&mdash;In Jerdan's <i>Autobiography</i>, vol. iii.,
published in 1852, we read this anecdote:</p>

<blockquote><p>"At a City dinner, so political that the three Consuls of France
were drunk, the toast-master, quite unacquainted with Bonaparte,
Cambac&egrave;res, and Lebrun, hallooed out from behind the chair,
'Gentlemen, fill bumpers! The chairman gives the Three per Cent.
Consols!'"</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Merrie England in the Olden Time</i>, vol. ii. p. 70. (published ten
years before), will be found the following note:</p>

<blockquote><p>"This eminent professor (toast-master Toole), whose sobriquet is
'Lungs,' having to shout the health of the 'three present
Consuls,' at my Lord Mayor's feast, proclaimed the health of the
'Three per Cent. Consols!'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>latter</i> version is the <i>correct</i> one. It was the three foreign
Consuls who were present among this annual gathering of grandees that
was given; not Bonaparte, Cambac&egrave;res, and Lebrun. The after-dinner organ
of Toole might easily, on hearing the toast, mistake "present" for "per
cent.," and "Consuls" (in the City, too) for "Consols."</p>

<h2><b>Queries.</b></h2>


<h3>WOLVES NURSING CHILDREN.</h3>

<p>At the meeting of the Cambrian Arch&aelig;ological Society, Lord Cawdor in the
chair, I read a letter on this subject from the resident at Lucknow,
Colonel Sleeman, to whom India is indebted for the suppression of
Thuggee, and other widely extended benefits. Though backed by such good
authority, the letter in question was received with considerable
incredulity, although Colonel Sleeman represents that he has with him
one of these wolf-nurtured youths.</p>

<p>Since reading the letter, I have received from the Colonel's brother a
more full account, printed in India, and containing additional cases,
which I should have no objection to print in the pages of "N. &amp; Q." In
the meantime, further information from Indian experience, where mothers
so often expose their children, would be thankfully received.</p>

<p>I appended my letter, for want of a better opportunity, and at the
request of several members, to a paper on the doctrine of the Myth, read
at the time; observing, that if the account is credible, perhaps Niebuhr
may have been precipitate in treating the nurture of the founders of
Rome as fabulous, and consigning to the Myth facts of infrequent
occurrence. There is both danger and the want of philosophy in rejecting
the marvellous, merely as such.</p>

<p>Nor is the invention of Lupa, for the name of the mother of the Roman
twins, by any means satisfactory. May not the mysteries of Lycanthropy
have had their origin in such a not infrequent fact, if Col. Sleeman may
be trusted, as the rearing of infants by wolves?</p>

<h3>"THE LUNEBURG TABLE."&mdash;QUEEN ELIZABETH'S LOVE OF PEARLS.</h3>

<p>In the <i>Travels</i> of Hentzner, who resided some time in England in the
reign of Elizabeth, as tutor to a young German nobleman, there is given
(as most of your readers will doubtless remember) a very interesting
account of the "Maiden Queen," and the court which she then maintained
at "the royal palace of Greenwich." After noticing the appearance of the
presence-chamber,&mdash;"the floor, after the English fashion, strewed with
hay,"&mdash;the writer gives a descriptive portrait of her Majesty. He
states,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Next came the Queen, in her sixty-fifth year, as we were told,
very majestic; her face oblong, fair, but wrinkled; her eyes
small, but black and pleasant; her nose a little hooked; her
lips narrow, and her teeth black (a defect the English seem
subject to, from their too great use of sugar). She had in her
ears two <i>pearls</i>, with very rich drops.<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> She wore false hair,
and that red."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page356" id="page356">{356}</a></span></p>

<p>Then comes the passage to which I beg to call especial attention, and on
which I have to invite some information:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Upon her head a small crown, <i>reported to be made of some of
the gold of the celebrated Luneburg table</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>What was this table? The work from which I quote (<i>Recollections of
Royalty</i>, vol. ii. p. 119.) has a note hereon, merely remarking that,
"at this distance of time, it is difficult to say what this was." If,
anything, however, can be gleaned on the subject, some of the readers of
"N. &amp; Q." in some one of the "five <i>quarters</i>" of the world will
assuredly be able to answer this Query.</p>

<p class='author'>J. J. S.</p>

<p>Middle Temple.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Since the above was written, I find that Elizabeth's christening
gift from the Duchess of Norfolk was a cup of gold, fretted with
<i>pearls</i>; that noble lady being (says Miss Strickland) "completely
unconscious of the chemical antipathy between the acidity of wine and
the misplaced pearls." Elizabeth seems thus to have been rich in those
gems from her infancy upwards, and to have retained a passionate taste
for them long after their appropriateness as ornaments for her had
ceased.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote">
<p><a id="footnote2" name="footnote2"></a> <b>Footnote 2</b>:
    <a href="#footnotetag2">(return)</a></p>

<p> With respect to the rich pearl earrings above mentioned, it
may not be uninteresting to remark, that Elizabeth seems to have been
particularly fond of pearls, and to have possessed the same taste for
them from youth to even a later period than "her sixty-fifth year." The
now faded wax-work effigy preserved in Westminster Abbey (and which lay
on her coffin, arrayed in royal robes, at her funeral, and caused, as

<i>pearls</i>, &amp;c. about her throat; her neck ornamented with long strings of
<i>pearls</i>; her high-heeled shoe-bows having in the centre large <i>pearl</i>
medallions. Her earrings are circular <i>pearl</i> and ruby medallions, with
large pear-shaped <i>pearl</i> pendants. This, of course, represents her as

shows the same taste as existing at that age. She is here depicted in a
black dress, trimmed with a double row of <i>pearls</i>. Her point-lace
ruffles are looped with <i>pearls</i>, &amp;c. Her head-dress is decorated in
front with a jewel set with <i>pearls</i>, from which three pear-shaped
<i>pearls</i> depend. And, finally, she has large <i>pearl</i>-tassel earrings. In
the Henham Hall portrait (engraved in vol. vii. of Miss Strickland's
<i>Lives of the Queens of England</i>), the ruff is confined by a collar of
<i>pearls</i>, rubies, &amp;c., set in a gold filagree pattern, with large pear
shaped <i>pearls</i> depending from each lozenge. The sleeves are ornamented
with rouleaus, wreathed with <i>pearls</i> and bullion. The lappets of her
head-dress also are adorned at every "crossing" with a large round

treatise to prove it; but in the <i>Biographie Universelle</i> it is stated
(I know not on what authority) that Cardinal Lambertini, afterwards
Benedict XIV., having summoned that lawyer to produce the originals,
Machiavelli deferred, and refused at last to obey the order: and
further, that Cuper the Bollandist wrote on the same subject to some

Machiavelli's dissertation had been forged by him, and written in the

<p><i>The Cross given by Richard I. to the Patriarch of Antioch.</i>&mdash;The "hero
of Acre," Sir Sidney Smith, received from the hands of the Archbishop of
Cyprus, in the name of a grateful people, a cross of which the tradition
was, that it had been given by King Richard C&#339;ur de Lion to the
Patriarch of Antioch, when he went to Palestine on the third Croisade.
This gift was preserved by Sir Sidney with the care due to a relique so
venerable in its associations; and it was bequeathed by him to the
Convent of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, at Paris, as successors
of the Templars, from whose Order it originally came. He directed that
it should be worn by the grand masters in perpetuity. In the
biographical memoirs of Sir Sidney Smith, published a few years ago, the
cross is stated to be preserved in the house of the Order at Paris.
Perhaps some member of the Order residing there would take the trouble
to give some description of this interesting relique, and would say
whether its style and character are consistent with the tradition of its
antiquity? I am not at all acquainted with the evidence on which the
tradition rests; but any particulars relating to such a relique must be
interesting to the countrymen of the illustrious admiral, and would much

<p><i>Lister Family.</i>&mdash;In a communication relating to Major-General Lambert
(Vol. vii, p. 269.), <span class="smcap">Lord Braybrooke</span> mentions his marriage with
Frances, daughter of Sir William Lister, of Thornton in Craven. I
imagine that this lady was sister to Sir Martin Lister, physician to
King Charles I., of whose (Sir Martin's) descendants I shall be glad of
any information.</p>

<p>Sir Martin Lister married Susanna, daughter of Sir Alexander Temple,
widow of Sir Gifford Thornhurst. This lady, by her first husband
(Thornhurst), had issue a daughter, who married Mr. Jennings, and became
the mother of three celebrated women; of whom one was Sarah, duchess of
Marlborough, wife of the great duke.</p>

<p>Had Sir Martin Lister any issue by her? and, if so, can their
descendants be traced?</p>

<p>Mr. Lister, of Burwell Park, Lincolnshire, is probably descended from
Sir Martin (if he left issue), or is of kin to him, through Dr. Martin
Lister, physician to Queen Anne, who, if not a son or grandson, was
certainly his nephew.</p>

<p>My mother's great-grandmother was a Lister, a daughter of Dr. Martin
Lister.</p>

<p><i>Eulenspiegel&mdash;Murner's Visit to England.</i>&mdash;Are any of your

tales<span class='pagenum'><a name="page358" id="page358">{358}</a></span> which go under the name of <i>Till Eulenspiegel</i>? I am searching to
find out which are the English translations, but have only succeeded to
trace two. The oldest is a very curious black-letter volume in small
4to. in the British Museum, C. 21. c/5,


formerly in the possession of
Mr. Garrick, as appears from Bishop Percy ("Dissertation on the Origin
of the British Stage," <i>Reliques</i>, vol. i. p. 134., ed. 1812). It is
entitled, "Here begynneth a merye Jest of a man that was called
Howleglas, and of many marucylous thinges and Jestes that he dyd in his
lyfe, in Eastlande and in many other places." Colophon: "Imprynted at
London in Tamestrete at the Vintre on the thre Craned wharfe by Wylliam
Copland."</p>

<p>Of the second I have only a reference of the title: <i>The German Rogue,
or the Life of Till Eulenspiegel</i>, 1709.</p>

<p>I am also anxious to learn whether there are any more notices about the
visit of Thomas Murner, the author of the German <i>Eulenspiegel</i>, in
England, besides that in a letter of Thomas More to Cardinal Wolsey in

<p><i>Aged 116.</i>&mdash;When your correspondents were all in a state of excitement
about the old Countess of Desmond, I ventured to ask for proof that some

<p>If this story be true, there can be no difficulty in proving it. The

administering relief to Nicholas Thane, formerly his confessor,
who was then a prisoner in Buckingham Castle for denying the
supremacy of the king, he was committed to the Marshalsea in
July, 1540, and was afterwards arraigned in Westminster Hall,

<blockquote><p>"A full-length marble statue, in judicial robes, erected by John
Snell, Esq., to the memory of his uncle, Judge Powell, who in
1685 represented this city, his native place, in parliament. He
was successively a Justice of Common Pleas and the King's Bench,
and was one of the Judges who tried the seven Bishops, and
joined in the declaration against the King's dispensing power.
For this, James II. deprived him of his office, July 2, 1688;
but William III. created him, first a Baron of the Exchequer,
then a Judge in the Common Pleas, and on June 18, 1702, advanced
him to the King's Bench, where he sat till his death, June 14,
1713."</p></blockquote>

<p>I will add, that on the floor near the above monument are inscribed the
names, &amp;c., of various members of his family.</p>

<p>Sir John Powell is traditionally said to have lived at an old house
called Wightfield in this county, which certainly belonged, at one time,
to the above John Snell, who had married the judge's niece, and from
whose descendants it was purchased by the grandfather of the present
possessor.</p>

on April 26, 1686, and a Judge of the King's Bench on April 16,

resolution he displayed on the trial of the seven bishops; but
was restored to the Bench, as a Judge of the Common Pleas, in
May, 1689, and continued to sit till his death in 1696.</p>

<p>2. Sir Thomas Powell became a Baron of the Exchequer on April
22, 1687, and was transferred into the King's Bench in June,
1688, to take the seat there left vacant by the removal of the
above Sir John Powell. He himself was removed in May, 1689.</p>

<p>3. Sir John Powell, or, as he was then called, John Powell,
junior, was made a Baron of the Exchequer on November 10, 1691,
removed into the Common Pleas on October 29, 1695, and into the

<h3>BROAD ARROW.</h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. iv., p. 412.)</p>

<p>With reference to my Note, ascribing a Celtic origin to this symbol, I
have just met with somewhat of a curious coincidence, to say the least
of it. In Richardson's <i>Travels in the Sahara, &amp;c.</i>, vol. i. p. 420.,
speaking of the camel, he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The camels have all public and private marks, the former for
their country, the latter for their owner; and, strange enough,
the public mark of the Ghadames camel is the English broad R."
&amp;c. [Arrow, he should have said.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, the Celtic <a href="images/broadarrow3.png"
title="Click to see an image of the arrow.">&#8593;</a>
 (as before mentioned) is
typical of superior holiness, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and it is singular that a city of
Marabouts (saints or holy men, such as the Ghadamsee are described to
be) should have adopted this symbol as their public (or government)
mark. The population of Ghadames is a strange medley of Arabs,
Touaricks, negroes, half-breeds of all kinds, &amp;c., and whence their
claim to superior sanctity does not appear.</p>

<p>That Celtic tribes once sojourned in Northern Africa is attested by
Druidical remains in Morocco and elsewhere. Mr. Richardson mentions the
frequent occurrence of pyramidal stones in the Sahara, incidentally,
without specifying whether they are rocks <i>in sit&ucirc;</i>, or supposed to be
the work of man's hand. The language of Ghadames is one of the Berber
dialects; and according to Mr. Urquhart (<i>Pillars of Hercules</i>, vol. i.
p. 383.), these, or some of them, are said to contain so much of the
Celtic element, that Highlanders from the garrison of Gibraltar, and the
natives about Tangier, can mutually understand each other.</p>

<p>The above, however, are mere speculations; and I would suggest that,
previous to further research as to the origin of the broad arrow, it
would be as well to ascertain how long it has been used as "the King's
mark." I should incline to believe that the earliest mark upon
government stores was the royal cipher&mdash;ER (with a crown above) perhaps.
On old guns of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, we find the rose and crown,
but no broad arrow; more frequently Elizabeth's bear her cipher. A few
articles I have seen of William III. are stamped with
<a href="images/WR1.png"
title="The W &amp; R are joined. Click to see an image.">WR</a> (with a crown above): no broad arrow. Nor do I remember
having ever seen it upon anything older than George III. This, however,
is a question which may interest some gentleman of the Ordnance
Department, and induce him to make research where success is most likely
to reward his trouble, viz. in the Tower, in the Royal Arsenal at
Woolwich, or amongst the ancient records in the Ordnance Office; for I
presume there be such.</p>

<p>P. C. S. S. (Vol. iv., p. 371.) says that "he always understood" the
broad arrow represented the "Pheon" in the arms of the Sydney family;
but, as he quotes no authority, we are at liberty to doubt the adoption
and perpetuation of a bearing appertaining to any particular

<h3>THE SWEET SINGERS.</h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. v., p. 372.)</p>

<p>A. N. asks for some historical notices of the above fanatics: as he may
not be satisfied with Timperley's meagre allusion, allow me to refer him
to the <i>Memoirs of the Lord Viscount Dundee</i>: London, 1714. The author
of this, "An Officer of the Army," speaking of the stiff-necked
Presbyterians, says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"At this time (1681), about thirty of these deluded people left
their families and business, and went to the hills, where they
lived in rocks and caves for some weeks. John Gib, sailor in
Borrowstowness, Walter Ker, in Trafritham, <span class="ohdash">&mdash;</span>&mdash; Gemmison, in
Linlithgow, were their chief leaders. They called themselves the
<i>Sweet Singers</i> of Israel, eat nothing that there was salt in or
paid tax to the king, blotted the name of king out of their
Bibles, and cohabited all together. When a party of dragoons
took them at the Ouffins, in Tweeddale, they were all lying on
their faces, and jumped up in a minute, and called out with an
audible voice, that God Almighty would consume the party with
fire from heaven, for troubling the people of God. On the road,
as they went to Edinburgh, when any of their relations or
acquaintances came to visit them, they spit at them, and threw
themselves on their faces, and bellowed like beasts, whereof his
Highness (the Duke of York, then in Scotland) being informed,
ordered them immediately to be set at liberty."</p></blockquote>

<p>A more detailed account of these Gibbites will be found in the curious
Presbyterian biographies "collected by, and printed for Patrick Walker,
in the Bristo-Port of Edinburgh," the early part of last century. In
that entitled "Some remarkable Passages in the Life, &amp;c. of Mr. Daniel
Cargill:" 12mo. Edin. 1732, A. N. will find the original story of the
crazy skipper and his band of "three men and twenty-six women," whom
worthy Mr. Cargill endeavoured unsuccessfully to reclaim. From this it
would appear that the <i>sweet singers</i> went far greater lengths than
above described, and that Gib, after the dispersion of his followers,
took himself off to America, "where," says the aforesaid Patrick, "he
was much admired by the blind<span class='pagenum'><a name="page362" id="page362">{362}</a></span> Indians for his familiar converse with
the devil." For the further information of your correspondent, I would
add that Walker's account of the Gibbites is very well condensed in that
more accessible book <i>Biographia Scoticana</i>, better known as the <i>Scots
Worthies</i>, where the deluded Gib figures under the head of "God's
Justice exemplified in his Judgments upon Persecutors."</p>

<h3>EDMUND SPENSER.</h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. vii., p. 303.)</p>

<p>Mr. F. F. Spenser published the results of his researches relative to
Spenser in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for August, 1842; and towards the
end of his communication promised to record "many further interesting
particulars," through the same medium, but failed to do so. Mr. Craik
has made special reference to Mr. F. F. Spenser's paper in a little work
upon which he must have bestowed a vast deal of labour, and which
contains the completest investigation of all that has been discovered
concerning the life, works, and descendants of the poet that I have met
with: I refer to <i>Spenser and his Poetry</i>: by George L. Craik, M.A.: 3
vols. London, 1845. The appendix to vol. iii., devoted to an account of
the descendants of Spenser, among other interesting matter, contains the
history of the family descended from Sarah Spenser, a sister of Edmund
Spenser, which is still represented. To which I may add that Spenser's
own direct descendants are living in the city of Cork, and, I regret to
say, in reduced circumstances. This should not be. A pension might well
be bestowed on the descendants of Spenser, the only one of our four
great poets whose posterity is not extinct.</p>

<p class='author'>J. M. B.</p>

<p>Tunbridge Wells.</p>

<p>I have read with much curiosity and surprise a paragraph engrafted into
"N. &amp; Q." (Vol. vii., p. 33.) from <i>The Times</i> newspaper, June 16, 1841,
announcing that a Mr. F. F. Spenser, of Halifax, had ascertained that
the ancient residence of his own family, at Hurstwood, near Burnley,
Lancashire, was the identical spot where the great Elizabethan poet,
Edmund Spenser, is said to have retired, when driven by academical
disappointments to his relations in the north of England.</p>

<p>I confess all this appears to me very like a hoax, there is such a
weight of negative testimony against it. Dr. Whitaker, the learned
historian of Whalley, describes Hurstwood Hall as a strong and
well-built old house, bearing on its front, in large characters, the
name of "Barnard Townley," its founder, and that it was for several
descents the property and residence of a family branched out from the
parent stock of Townley, in the person of John Townley, third son of Sir
Richard Townley, of Townley&mdash;died Sept. 1562. His son, Barnard Townley,
died 1602, and married Agnes, daughter and coheiress of George Ormeroyd,
of Ormeroyd, who died 1586.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Hurstwood is in the immediate neighbourhood
of Dr. Whitaker's ancient patrimonial estate of Holme; and he must have
been familiar with all the traditionary history of that locality. Yet he
is silent on this subject, and does not allude either to the occasional
residence of the poet Spenser in those parts, or to the family of
Spensers, who are stated in this paragraph to have resided at Hurstwood
about four hundred years.</p>

<h3>LAMECH KILLING CAIN.</h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. vii., p. 305.)</p>

<p>Sir John Maundeville says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Also, seven miles from Nazareth is Mount Cain, under which is a
well; and beside that well Lamech, Noah's father, slew Cain with
an arrow. For this Cain went through briars and bushes, as a
wild beast; and he had lived from the time of Adam, his father,
unto the time of Noah; and so he lived nearly two thousand
years. And Lamech was blind for old age."&mdash;<i>Travels</i>, chap. x.,
Bohn's <i>Early Travels in Palestine</i>, p. 186.</p></blockquote>

<p>To which is appended the following note by Mr. Thomas Wright, the
editor:</p>

<blockquote><p>"This legend arose out of an interpretation given to Gen. iv.
23, 24. See, as an illustration, the scene in the <i>Coventry
Mysteries</i>, pp. 44. 46.</p></blockquote>

<p class='author'><span class="smcap">Zeus.</span></p>

<p>J. W. M. will find this question discussed at length in the
<i>Dictionnaire de Bayle</i>, art. "Lamech," and more briefly in <i>Pol.
Synopsis Criticorum</i>, Gen. iv. 23.</p>

<p>The subject has been engraved by Lasinio in his <i>Pitture a fresco del
Campo Santo di Pisa</i> (tom. xvii.), after the original fresco by
Buonamico Buffalmacco, whose name is so familiar to readers of the
<i>Decameron</i>.</p>

<p class='author'>F. C. B.</p>

<p>Bayle relates this legend in his account of Lamech as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>"There is a common tradition that Lamech, who had been a great
lover of hunting, continued the sport even when, by reason of
his great age, he was almost blind. He took with him his son,
Tubal-Cain, who not only served him as a guide, but also
directed him where and when he ought to shoot at the beast. One
day, as Cain was hid among the thickets, Lamech's guide seeing
something move in that place, gave him notice of it; whereupon
Lamech shot an arrow, and slew Cain. He was extremely concerned
at it, and beat his guide so much as to leave him dead upon the
place."</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the frescos of the Campo Santo at Pisa gives the whole subject,
from the offering of Abel's and Cain's sacrifice, to the death of the
young man<span class='pagenum'><a name="page363" id="page363">{363}</a></span> by the hand of Lamech, painted by Pietre da Orvieto about
1390. In one corner of the fresco, Cain is depicted as a wild and shaggy
figure, crouched in a thicket, at which Lamech, at the suggestion of his
guide, shoots an arrow. Below, the homicide is represented as murdering
the cause of his error by blows on the head inflicted with his bow.</p>

<p class='author'><span class="smcap">Cheverells.</span></p>

<p>The following note upon the name of Lamech may perhaps serve to throw a
little light upon the difficult passage in Genesis iv. 23,
24.&mdash;<i>Lamech</i>, in Celtic <i>Lamaich</i>, or <i>Laimaig</i>, means a slinger of
stones; and Lamech being dextrous in the use of that weapon the sling,
wantonly slew two young men, and boasted of the bloody deed to his two
wives, Adah and Zillah, blasphemously maintaining that as Cain for one
murder should be avenged sevenfold, so he, for his wanton act, would be
avenged seventy and seven fold upon whoever should slay him. It may be
considered strange that the name of Lamech should be Celtic, and that it
should signify a slinger; but I am strengthened in my opinion by
reference to the Hebrew alphabet, in which the letter <i>l</i> is called
<i>lamed</i>; but why it is so named the Hebrews cannot say. Now, if any one
examines the Hebrew <span lang='he' title='lamed'>&#1500;</span> he will perceive that it is by no
means a rude representation of a human arm, holding a sling with a stone
in it. The word <i>Lamech</i> is derived from <i>lam</i>, the hand; and the
termination signifies dexterity in shooting or discharging missiles
therewith.</p>

<p>It is curious to notice that the remaining names in the passage of
Scripture are Celtic: thus Cain is compounded of <i>cend</i>, first, and
<i>gein</i>, offspring,&mdash;pronounced <i>Kayean</i>, <i>i. e.</i> first begotten. Adah
means a fair complexioned, red-haired woman; and Zillah, peace, from
<i>siotlad</i>, pronounced <i>shieta</i>.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

<p><i>Photographic Notes.</i>&mdash;G. H. P. has communicated (Vol. vii., p. 186.) a
very excellent paper in reference to our numerous failures in the
collodion process; but the remedies he proposes are not, as he is aware,
infallible. He gives the recommendation you find in every work on the
subject, viz. to lift the plate up and down in the bath to allow
evaporation of ether. I have made experiments day after day to ascertain
the value of this advice, and I am convinced, as far as my practice
goes, that you gain nothing by it; indeed, I am sure that I much oftener
get a more even film when the plate is left in the bath for about two
minutes without lifting it out. I should be glad of other photographers'
opinion on the point.</p>

<p>I have never found any benefit, but much the contrary, from re-dipping
the plate in the bath; and I may observe the same of mixing a drop or
two of silver solution with the developing fluid.</p>

<p>I think with G. H. P. that the developing solution should be weak for
positives.</p>

<p>I omitted, in my description of a new head-rest, to say that it is
better to have all the parts in metal; and that the hole, through which
the arm runs, should be a square mortice instead of a round one, as is
usual. A screw at the side sets it fast; the lower portion of the
upright piece being round, and sliding up and down in a tube of metal,
as it does in the best rests, allowing the sitter to be placed in
different positions. All this is very difficult to describe, but a
slight diagram would explain it easily, which I would willingly, as I
have before said, send to any one thinking it worth writing to me for.</p>

<p><i>On some Difficulties in Photographic Practice.</i>&mdash;Being desirous to have
a glass bath for the silver, I was glad to find you had given (in
"Notices to Correspondents") directions for making one, viz. two parts
best red sealing-wax to one part of Jeffries' marine glue. I tried this,
but found the application of it to the glass impossible, as it set
immediately. Now, can you afford room for the means by which this may be
remedied; as my wish to substitute glass for gutta percha remains?</p>

<p>Now I am addressing you, may I offer one or two hints which may be of
service to beginners? If, after what has been considered a sufficient
washing of the glass, after the hypo., during the drying, crystals from
hypo. remaining appear, and which would most certainly destroy the
picture, I have found that by <i>breathing well</i> over these parts, and
immediately repeating the washing, all ill effects are thoroughly
prevented. To substitute hot water instead of breathing does not destroy
the hyposulphite, and therefore will not do.</p>

<p>When the plate shall be dry after the washing process, if a leaden, dim,
grey appearance occurs, I have found that by tenderly rubbing it with
fine cotton, and applying with a good-sized camel's hair pencil a
varnish of about 8-10ths spirits of turpentine and 2-10ths mastic
varnish, and then, before this gets dry, putting on the black varnish,
the grey effect will have been removed.</p>

<p>I have found the protonitrate of iron, as also the protosulphate, and
not seldom the pyrogallic, so difficult of application, that I have
stained and spoiled very good pictures. I have therefore used, and with
perfect success, a tray of gutta percha a little longer than the glass
(say one-fourth of an inch), and one-fourth of an inch deep; sliding
from one end the glass into the tray (supplied immediately before using
it), by which means the glass is all covered at once.</p>

<p>I think the <span class="smcap">Rev. Mr. Sisson's</span> suggestion, viz. to send you some
of our specimens with collodion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="page364" id="page364">{364}</a></span> a very proper one, if not declined on
your own part, and shall, for one, feel great pleasure in acting in
accordance with it.</p>

<p>You will, I trust, pardon any foregoing hints for beginners, as I well
know that I have lost several pictures by hypo-crystals, and very many
by the difficulty in developing.</p>

<p class='author'><span class="smcap">L. Merritt.</span></p>

<p>Maidstone.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I always find collodion by <span class="smcap">Dr. Diamond's</span> formula capital,
and with it from five to ten seconds is time enough.</p>


<p><i>Mr. Weld Taylor's cheap Iodizing Process.</i>&mdash;I have no doubt <span class="smcap">Mr.
Weld Taylor</span> will be kind enough to explain to me two difficulties I
find in his cheap iodizing process for paper.</p>

<p>In the first place, whence arises the caustic condition of his solution,
unless it be through the decomposition of the cyanide of potassium which
is sometimes added? and if such caustic condition exists, does it not
cause a deposition of oxide of silver together with the iodide, thereby
embrowning the paper?</p>

<p>Why does the caustic condition of the solution require a larger dose of
nitrate of silver, and does not this larger quantity of nitrate of
silver more than outbalance the difference between the new process and
the old, as regards price? I pay 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for an ounce of iodide of
potassium of purest quality; the commoner commercial quality is cheaper.</p>

<p><i>Family of De Thurnham</i> (Vol. vii., p. 261.).&mdash;In reply to &#920;.  I send a few notes illustrative of the pedigree, &amp;c. of the De
Thurnhams, lords of Thurnham, in Kent, deduced from Dugdale, public
records, and MS. charters in my possession, namely, the MS. Rolls of
Combwell Priory, which was founded by Robert de Thurnham the elder; from
which it appears that Robert de Thurnham, who lived tempore Hen. II.,
had two sons, Robert and Stephen. Of these, Robert married Joan,
daughter of William Fossard, and died 13 John, leaving a daughter and
sole heir Isabel, for whose marriage Peter de Maulay had to pay 7000
marks, which were allowed him in his accounts for services rendered to
the crown. Stephen, the other son, married Edelina, daughter of Ralph de
Broc, and, dying circiter 16 John, was buried in Waverley Abbey, Surrey.
He seems to have left five daughters and coheirs; viz. Mabilia, wife of
Ralph de Gatton, and afterwards of Thomas de Bavelingeham; Alice, wife
of Adam de Bending; Alianore, wife of Roger de Leybourne; Beatrice, wife
of Ralph de Fay; and Alienore, wife of Ralph Fitz-Bernard. Dugdale and
the Combwell Rolls speak of only four daughters, making no mention of
the wife of Ralph Fitz-Bernard; but an entry on the Fine Rolls would
seem almost necessarily to imply that she was one of the five daughters
and coheiresses. If not a <i>daughter</i>, she was in <i>some way</i> coheiress
with the daughters; which is confirmed by an entry in <i>Testa de Nevill</i>:
and, by a charter temp. Edw. I., I find Roger de Northwood, husband of
Bona Fitz-Bernard, in possession of the manor of Thurnham, with every
appearance of its having been by inheritance of his wife. With this
explanation, I have ventured to include Alianore, wife of Ralph
Fitz-Bernard, as among the daughters and coheiresses of Stephen de
Thurnham. The issue of all of these marriages, after a few years,
terminated in female representatives&mdash;among them the great infanta
Juliana de Leybourne&mdash;mingling their blood with the Denes, Towns,
Northwoods, Wattons, &amp;c., and other ancient families of Kent.</p>

<p>I have two beautiful seals of Sir Stephen de Thurnham temp. John,&mdash;a
knight fully caparisoned on horseback, but not a trace of armorial
bearings on his shield; nor, in truth, could we expect to find any such
assigned to him at that early period.</p>

in its original position, on the <i>left</i>-hand of the road as you pass
through that village to Ruthin. Woodward, who was landlord of the inn at
the time Wilson frequented it, survived his friend<span class='pagenum'><a name="page365" id="page365">{365}</a></span> about sixteen years,
leaving six children (two sons and four daughters), none of whom
however, as <span class="smcap">Cambrensis</span> surmises, succeeded him as landlord. His
widow shortly afterwards married Edward Griffiths, a man many years her
Junior, and who, at the period <span class="smcap">Cambrensis</span> alludes to, and for a
lone time previous, was "mine host" of the "Loggerheads." Griffiths died
about three years ago, after amassing a large property by mining
speculations in the neighbourhood. There are, I believe, several fine
paintings by Wilson in the new hall of Colomendy, now the residence of
the relict of Col. Garnons. The old house, where Wilson lived, was taken
down about thirty years ago, to make way for the present structure.</p>

<p><i>Grafts and the Parent Tree</i> (Vol. vii., p. 261.).&mdash;In reply to J. P. of

the parent tree decays," is merely one among a host of superstitions
reverently cherished by florists. The fact is, that grafts, after some
fifteen years, wear themselves out. Of course there cannot be wanting
many examples of the almost synchronous demise of parent and graft. From
such cases, no doubt, the myth in question took its rise.</p>

<p><i>The Lisle Family</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 236. 269.).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mr. Garland's</span>
Query has induced me to inquire, through the same channel, whether
anything is known about a family of this name, some of whom are buried
at Thruxton in Hampshire. There are four monuments in the church, two of
which are certainly, the others probably, erected to members of the
family. The first is a very fine brass (described in the Oxford
<i>Catalogue of Brasses</i>), inscribed to Sir John Lisle, Lord of Boddington
in the Isle of Wight, who died <small>A.D.</small> 1407. The next in
date, and I suppose of much the same period, is an altar-tomb under an
arch, which seems to have led into a small chantry. On this there are no
arms, and no inscription. The tomb is now surmounted by the figure of a
Crusader, which once lay outside the church, and is thought to be one of
the Lisles, and the founder of the original church. On the north side of
the chancel two arches looked into what was once a chantry chapel. In
the eastern arch is an altar-tomb, once adorned with shields, which are
now torn off. This chantry stood within the memory of "the oldest
inhabitant;" but it was pulled down by the owner of the land
appertaining to the chantry, and of its materials was built the church
tower. One of its windows forms the tower window, and its battlements
and pinnacles serve their old purpose in their new position. A modern
vestry occupies part of the site of the chantry, and shows one side the
altar-tomb I have last mentioned. This side has been refaced in Jacobian
style, and the arms of Lisle and Courtenay, and one other coat (the same
which occur on the brass), form part of the decoration. Two figures
belonging to this later work lie now on the altar-tomb, and many more
are remembered to have existed inside the chantry. The mixture of this
late Jacobian work with the old work of the chantry is very curious, and
can be traced all over what remains of it. The initials T. L. appear on
shields under the tower battlements.</p>

<p>I should be glad to find that these Lisles would throw any light on the
subject of <span class="smcap">Mr. Garland's</span> inquiry; and if they do not, perhaps
some of your readers can give some information about them.</p>

<p><i>The Dodo in Ceylon</i> (Vol. vii., p. 188.).&mdash;The bird which <span class="smcap">Sir J.
Emerson Tennent</span> identifies with the dodo is common on Ceylonese
sculpture. The natives say it is now extinct, and call it the
<i>Hangsiya</i>, or sacred goose; but whether deemed sacred for the same
reason as the Capitoline goose, or otherwise, I must leave the author of
<i>Eleven Years in Ceylon</i> to explain, he being the person in this country
most conversant with Ceylonese mythology.</p>

<p>I now wish to call <span class="smcap">Sir Emerson's</span> attention to a coincidence
that may be worthy his notice in connexion with his forthcoming work on
Ceylon.</p>

<p>If he will take the trouble to examine the model of the Parthenon, in
the Elgin Marble room of the British Museum, he cannot fail, to be
struck with its resemblance to the beautiful building he visited at
Polonaroowa, called the Jaitoowanarama. The dimensions of the respective
buildings I cannot at present ascertain; but the ground-plans are
precisely similar, and each was roofless. But the most striking
resemblance is in the position and altitude of the statues: that of the
gigantic Bhoodho is precisely similar, even in the posture of the right
arm and hand, to that of Minerva, the masterpiece of Phidias. On
consulting his notes, he may find the height of the statues to
correspond. That of Phidias was thirty-nine feet.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Watson, Bishop of St. David's, 1687-99</i> (Vol. vii., p.
234.).&mdash;This harshly-treated prelate died at Great Wilbraham, near
Cambridge, on June 3, 1717, &aelig;t. eighty years; and, from a private letter
written at the time, seems to have been buried in haste in the chancel
of that church, "but without any service," which may perhaps imply that
there was not a funeral sermon, and the ordinary ceremony at a prelate's
burial. It is, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="page366" id="page366">{366}</a></span>ever intimated that he died excommunicated. In
Paulson's <i>History of Holderness</i> is a notice of Bishop Watson, and of
his relatives the Medleys, who are connected with my family by marriage;
but the statement that the bishop "died in the Tower" is incorrect (vol.
i. Part II. p. 283.; vol. ii. Part I. p. 47.; Part II. p. 542., 4to.,
1840-1).</p>

<p><i>Etymology of Fuss</i> (Vol. vii., p. 180.).&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Fuss</span>, <i>n. s.</i>, a low, cant word, Dr. Johnson says. It
is, however, a regularly-descended northern word: Sax.
<a href="images/fusx3.png"
title="fus, click to see an image of the original font.">&#401;u&#383;</a>, prompt, eager; Su. Goth. and Cimbr. <i>f u s</i>, the same;
hence the Sax. <a href="images/fysan1.png"
title="fysan, click to see an image of the original font.">&#401;&#7823;&#383;an</a>, to hasten, and the Su. Goth. <i>f
y s a</i>, the same."&mdash;Todd's <i>Johnson</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Richardson gives the same etymology, referring to Somner. Webster says,
"allied, perhaps, to Gr. <span lang='el' title='physa&ocirc;'>&#966;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#969;</span>,
to blow or puff."</p>

<p class='author'><span class="smcap">Zeus.</span></p>

<p>A reference to the word in Todd's <i>Johnson's Dictionary</i> will show, and
I think satisfactorily, that its origin is <i>fus</i> (Anglo-Saxon), prompt
or eager; hence <i>fysan</i>, to hasten. The quotation given is from Swift.</p>

<p><i>Nugget</i> (Vol. vi., pp. 171. 281.; Vol. vii., pp. 143.
272.).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Furvus</span> is persuaded that the word <i>nugget</i> is of home
growth, and has sprung from a root existing under various forms
throughout the dialects at present in use. The radical appears to be
<i>snag</i>, <i>knag</i>, or <i>nag</i> (<i>Knoge</i>, Cordylus, cf. <i>Knuckle</i>), a
protuberance, knot, lump; being a term chiefly applied to knots in
trees, rough pieces of wood, &amp;c., and in its derivatives strongly
expressive of (so to speak) misshapen <i>lumpiness</i>.</p>

<p>Every one resident in the midland counties must be acquainted with the
word <i>nog</i>, applied to the wooden ball used in the game of "shinney,"
the corresponding term of which, <i>nacket</i>, holds in parts of Scotland,
where also a short, corpulent person is called a <i>nuget</i>.</p>

<p>So, in Essex, <i>nig</i> signifies a piece; a <i>snag</i> is a well-known word
across the Atlantic; <i>nogs</i> are ninepins in the north of England; a
<i>noggin</i> of bread is equivalent to a <i>hunch</i> in the midland counties;
and in the neighbourhood of the Parret and Exe the word becomes <i>nug</i>,
bearing (besides its usual acceptation) the meaning of <i>knot</i>, <i>lump</i>.</p>

<p>This supposed derivation is by no means weakened by the fact, that
miners and others have gone to the "diggins" from parts at no great
distance from the last-mentioned district; and we may therefore,
although the radical is pretty generally diffused over the kingdom,
attribute its better known application to <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>It is no objection that the word, in many of its forms, is used of rough
pieces of <i>wood</i>, as instances show that it merely refers to a <i>rudis
indigestaque moles</i> characteristic of any article in question.</p>

having adopted the manners of the land, had become more Irish than the
Irishry." The expression originally was applied to these persons in some
proclamation or act of parliament, which I think is quoted in the
<i>History of England</i> in Lardner's <i>Cabinet Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>: but that work
has so bad an index as to make it very difficult to find any passage one
may want. Probably Southey would mention the source whence he had it, in
his collections for his <i>Naval History</i> in his Commonplace Book.</p>

<p><i>Swedish Words current in England</i> (Vol. ii., p. 231.).&mdash;I beg to inform
your correspondent that the following words, which occur in his list,
are pure Anglo-Saxon, bearing almost the same mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="page367" id="page367">{367}</a></span>ing which he has
attributed to them:&mdash;<i>w&yuml;rm</i>; <i>by</i>, <i>bya</i>, to inhabit, <i>becc</i>; <i>dioful</i>;
<i>dobl</i>, equivalent to <i>doalig</i>: <i>g&oelig;pung</i>, a heap; <i>lacan</i>; <i>loppe</i>;
<i>nebb</i>; <i>smiting</i>, contagion; <i>st&aelig;th</i>, a fixed basis.</p>

<p><i>Eldon</i> is Icelandic, from <i>elldr</i>, fire: hence we have "At sl&aacute; elld &uacute;r
tinnu," to strike fire from flint; which approaches very near to a
tinder-box. <i>Ling</i>, Icel., the heath or heather plant: <i>ljung</i> I take to
be the same word. <i>Gat</i>, Icel. for way or opening; hence <i>strand-gata</i>,
the opening of the strand or creek. <i>Tjarn</i>, <i>tiorn</i>, Icel., well
exemplified in Malham Tarn in Craven.</p>

<p><i>Gotch</i> (Vol. vi., p. 400.).&mdash;The <i>gotch cup</i>, described by W. R., must
have been known in England before the coming of the present royal
family, as it is given in Bailey's <i>Dictionary</i> (1730) as a south
country word: it is not likely to have become provincial in so short a
time, nor its origin, if German, to have escaped the notice of old
<span lang='el' title='Philologos'>&#934;&#953;&#955;&#8001;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>. The A.-S. verb <i>geotan</i> seems to have had the sense
of to cast metals, as <i>giessen</i> has in German. In Bosworth's
<i>Anglo-Saxon Dictionary</i> is <i>leadgota</i>, a plumber. In modern Dutch this
is <i>lootgieter</i>. Thus, from <i>geotan</i> is derived <i>ingot</i> (Germ.
<i>einguss</i>), as well as the following words in Halliwell's <i>Dictionary:
yete</i>, to cast metals (<i>Pr. Parv.</i>), <i>belleyetere</i> and <i>bellyatere</i>, a
bell-founder (<i>Pr. Parv.</i>); <i>geat</i>, the hole through which melted metal
runs into a mould; and <i>yote</i>, to pour in. Grose has <i>yoted</i>, watered, a
west country word.</p>

<p><i>Passage in Thomson: "Steaming"</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 87. 248.).&mdash;This word,
and not <i>streaming</i>, is clearly the true reading (as is remarked by the
former correspondents), and is so printed in the editions to which I am
able to refer. The object of my Note is to point out a parallel passage
in Milton, and to suggest that <i>steaming</i> would there also be the proper
reading:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Ye mists and exhalations, that now rise,</p>
<p>From hill or <i>streaming</i> lake, dusky or gray,</p>
<p>Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,</p>

<p><i>The Word "Party"</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 177. 247.).&mdash;The use of this word for
a particular person is earlier than Shakspeare's time. It no doubt
occurs in most of our earliest writers; for it is to be found in
Herbert's <i>Life of Henry VIII.</i>, in his translation of the "Centum
Gravamina" presented to Pope Adrian in 1521, the 55th running thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>"That, if one of the marryed couple take a journey either to the
warres, or to perform a vow, to a farre countrey, they permit
the <i>party</i> remaining at home, if the other stay long away, upon
a summe of money payd, to cohabite with another, not examining
sufficiently whether the absent party were dead."</p></blockquote>

<p>It may also be found in Exodus xxii. 9., where, though it occurs in the
plural, it refers to two individuals:</p>

<blockquote><p>"For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for
sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which
another challengeth to be his, the cause of both <i>parties</i> shall
come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, <i>he</i>
shall pay double unto his neighbour."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Curious Fact in Natural Philosophy</i> (Vol. vii., p. 206.).&mdash;In reply to
<span class="smcap">Elginensis</span> I send you a quotation from Dr. Golding Bird's
<i>Natural Philosophy</i> in explanation of this well-known phenomenon:</p>

<blockquote><p>"One very remarkable phenomenon connected with the escape of a
current of air under considerable pressure, must not be passed
over silently. M. Clement Desormes (<i>Ann. de Phys. et Chim.</i>,
xxxvi. p. 69.) has observed, that when an opening, about an inch
in diameter, is made in the side of a reservoir of compressed
air, the latter rushes out violently; and if a plate of metal or
wood, seven inches in diameter, be pressed towards the opening,
it will, after the first repulsive action of the current of air
is overcome, be apparently attracted, rapidly oscillating within
a short distance of the opening, out of which the air continues
to emit with considerable force. This curious circumstance is
explained on the supposition, that the current of air, on
escaping through the opening, expands itself into a thin disc,
to escape between the plate of wood or metal, and side of the
reservoir; and on reaching the circumference of the plate, draws
after it a current of atmospheric air from the opposite side....
The plate thus balanced between these currents remains near the
aperture, and apparently attracted by the current of air to
which it is opposed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. G. B. then describes the experiment quoted by <span class="smcap">Elginensis</span> as
"a similar phenomenon, and apparently explicable on similar principles."
(Bird's <i>Nat. Phil.</i>, p. 118.)</p>

<p class='author'><span class="smcap">Cokely.</span></p>


<p><i>Lowbell</i> (Vol. vii., p. 272.).&mdash;I may add to the explanation of this
word given by M. H., that <i>low</i>, derived from the Saxon <i>l&#339;g</i>, is
still commonly used in Scotland for a flame; hence the derivation of
<i>lowbell</i>, for a mode of birdcatching by night, by which the birds,
being awakened by the bell, are lured by the light into nets held by the
fowlers. In the ballad of <i>St. George for England</i>, we have the
following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"As timorous larks amazed are</p>
<p>With light and with a <i>lowbell</i>."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The term <i>lowbelling</i> may therefore, from the noise, be fitly applied to
the rustic <i>charivari</i> described by H. T. W. (Vol. vii., p. 181.) as
practised in Northamptonshire.</p>

<i>Life and Correspondence of S. T. Coleridge</i> (Vol. vii., p.

exists for a really good biography of this intellectual giant; but there
will be many dissentients as to the proposed biographer, whose life of
Hartley Coleridge cannot be regarded as a happy example of this class of
composition. A life from the pen of Judge Coleridge, the friend of
Arnold and Whateley, is, we think, far more to be desired.</p>

<p><i>Coniger, &amp;c.</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 182. 241.).&mdash;At one extremity, the
picturesque range of hills which forms the noble background of Dunster
Castle, co. Somerset, is terminated by a striking conical eminence,
well-wooded, and surmounted by an embattled tower, erected as an object
from the castle windows. This eminence bears the name of <i>The Coniger</i>,
and is now a pheasant preserve. Mr. Hamper, in an excellent notice of
Dunster and its antiquities, in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, October,
1808, p. 873., says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The <i>Conygre</i>, or rabbit-ground, was a common appendage to
manor-houses."</p></blockquote>

<p>Savage, however, in his <i>History of the Hundred of Carhampton</i>, p. 440.,
is of opinion that</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Coneygar</i> seems to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>Cyning</i>,
King; and the M&#339;so-Gothic <i>Garas</i>, the same as the Latin
<i>Domus</i>, a house, that is, the king's house or residence. Mr.
Hamper has some notion that <i>Conygre</i> means a rabbit-ground,
&amp;c., but Mr. H. does not go high enough for his etymology;
besides, how does it appear that a rabbit-ground was at any time
an appendage to manor-houses? There is no authority for the
assertion."</p></blockquote>

<p>I give you this criticism on Mr. Hamper <i>valeat quantum</i>, but am
disposed to think he is right. At all events there are no vestiges of
any building on the Coniger except the tower aforesaid, which was
erected by the present Mr. Luttrell's grandfather.</p>

<p class='author'><span class="smcap">Balliolensis.</span></p>

<p>In the Irish language, <i>Cuinicear</i>, pronounced "Keen&egrave;kar," is a
rabbit-warren. <i>Cuinin</i> is the diminutive of <i>cu</i>, a dog of any sort;
and from the Celtic <i>cu</i>, the Greeks took their word
<span lang='el' title='ky&ocirc;n'>&#954;&#965;&#969;&#957;</span>, a
dog. I am of opinion that the origin of rabbit is in the Celtic word
<i>rap</i>, i. e. a creature that digs and burrows in the ground.</p>

<p>The most important work, as throwing light upon the proceedings of the
Assembly, is the <i>Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</i>. The only

<i>Epigrams</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 175. 270.).&mdash;"Suum cuique" being a principle
which holds good with regard to literary property as well as to property
of every other description, I can inform your correspondent
<span class="smcap">Balliolensis</span> that the epigram on Dr. Toe, which he says was
"represented to have proceeded from the pen of Thomas Dunbar, of
Brasenose," was in reality the production of my respected neighbour, the
Rev. William Bradford, M.A., rector of Storrington, Sussex. It was
written by that gentleman when he was an undergraduate of St. John's
College, Oxford. <span class="smcap">Balliolensis</span> may rely upon the accuracy of
this information, as I had it from Mr. Bradford's own lips only
yesterday. The correct version of the epigram is that given by

<p>"<i>God and the world</i>" (Vol. vii., pp. 134. 297.).&mdash;These lines are
found, as quoted by W. H., in Coleridge's <i>Aids to Reflection</i>, p. 87.,
ed. 1831. Coleridge gives them as the words of a sage poet of the
preceding generation (meaning, I suppose, the generation preceding that
of Archbishop Leighton, a passage from whose works he has introduced as
an aphorism just before). I have often wondered who this poet was, and
whether the last line were really a quotation from <i>Macbeth</i>, or whether
Shakspeare and the unknown poet had both but borrowed a popular saying.
I also had my suspicions that Coleridge himself might have patched the
verses a little; and the communication of your correspondent
<span class="smcap">Rt.</span>, tracing the lines in their original form to the works of
Fulke Greville Lord Brooke, now verifies his conjecture. It may be worth
while to point out another instance of this kind of manufacture by the
same skilful hand. In the first volume of <i>The Friend</i> (p. 215., ed.
1818), Coleridge places at the head of an essay a quotation of two
stanzas from Daniel's <i>Musophilus</i>. The second, which precedes in the
original that which Coleridge places first, is thus given by him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"<i>Since writings</i> are the veins, the arteries,</p>
<p>And undecaying life-strings of those hearts,</p>
<p>That still shall pant and still shall exercise</p>

<p><i>And the strong constitution of their praise</i></p>
<p><i>Wear out the infection of distemper'd days.</i>"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Daniel wrote as follows (vol. ii. p. 373., ed. 1718):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><i>Skating Problem</i> (Vol. vii., p. 284.).&mdash;The Query of your correspondent
recalls the one said to have been put by King James to the members of
the Royal Society: "How is it," said the British Solomon, "that if two
buckets of water be equipoised in a balance, and a couple of live bream
be put into one of them, the bucket containing the fish does not
overweigh the other?" After some learned reasons had been adduced by
certain of the philosophers, one of them said, "Please your Majesty,
that bucket would be heavier by the exact weight of the fish." "Thou art
right," said the sapient king; "I did not think there had been so much
sense among you." Now, although I do not mean to say that <span class="smcap">A
Skater</span> propounds for elucidation what he knows to be a fallacy, yet
I do assert that he is mistaken as to the fact alleged. He recommends
any one who is "incredulous" to make the trial&mdash;in which case, the
experimenter would undoubtedly find himself in the water! I advise an
appeal to common sense and philosophy: the former will show that a
person in skates is not lighter than another; the latter, that ice will
not fracture less readily beneath the weight of an individual raised on
a pair of steel edges, than one on a pair of flat soles&mdash;<i>all other
circumstances being the same</i>; the reverse, indeed, would be the fact.
The true explanation of the "problem" is to be found in the
circumstance, that "a skater," rendered confident by the ease with which
he <i>glides</i> over ice on which <i>he</i> could <i>not stand</i>, will often also
"stand" securely on ice which would break under the restless feet of a
person in his shoes only. This has always appeared to be the obvious
reason for the apparent anomaly to one who is</p>

<p><i>Parochial Libraries</i> (Vol. vi., p. 432.).&mdash;Let me add to the list of
parochial libraries that at Wendlebury, Oxon, the gift of Robert
Welborn, rector, cir. 1760. It consists of about fifty volumes in folio,
chiefly works of the Fathers, and, if I remember rightly, Benedictine
editions. It was originally placed in the north transept of the church,
but afterwards removed to the rectory. I believe that the books were
intended for the use of the rector, but were to be lent to the
neighbouring clergy on a bond being given for their restoration. After
many years of sad neglect, this library was put into thorough order a
few years ago by the liberality of the Rev. Jacob Ley, student of Ch.
Ch.</p>

<h3>Notices to Correspondents.</h3>

<p>W. S. G. <i>is thanked. We have not inserted the two Folk Lore articles he
has sent, inasmuch as they are already recorded in Brand.</i></p>

<p>W. S. D. <i>The saying</i> "God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb," <i>made so
popular by its application to Sterne's "Maria," is from a French
proverb</i> "A brebis tondue Dieu mesure le vent," <i>which, in a somewhat
older form, is to be found in Gruter's</i> Florilegium: <i>Francfort, 1611</i>,
p. 353., <i>and in St. Estienne's</i> Premices, <i>published in 1594.&mdash;See our</i>
1st Vol., pp. 211. 236. 325. 357. 418.</p>

<p>C. M. I. <i>We propose to insert some articles on Shakspeare in our next
or following Number.</i></p>

<p>M. A. <i>and</i> J. L. S. <i>are referred to our</i> No. 172., p. 157.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Photography</span>. <i>Dr. Diamond's</i> Photographic Notes <i>are preparing
for immediate publication in a separate form. We may take this
opportunity of explaining that</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. D.</span> <i>is</i> only an amateur,
<i>and has nothing to do with Photography as a profession. We are the more
anxious to make this known, since, in consequence of holding an
important public office, Dr. Diamond has but little leisure for pursuing
his researches.</i></p>

<p>J. B. S. <i>will find what he requires at</i> p. 277. <i>of our last volume.</i></p>

<p>C. B. (Birmingham). <i>If the hyposulphite of soda is not thoroughly
removed from a Photograph, it will soon become covered with reddish
spots, and in a short time the whole picture may disappear. If cyanide
of potassium has been used, it is requisite that the greatest care
should be used to effect its removal entirely.</i></p>

<p>W. L. (Liverpool). <i>A meniscus lens of the diameter of four inches
should have a focal length of twenty inches, and will produce perfect
landscape pictures fourteen inches square. It is said they will cover
fifteen inches; but fourteen they do with great definition. We strongly
advise</i> W. L. <i>to purchase a good article. It is a bad economy not to go
to a</i> first-rate <i>maker at once.</i></p>

<p>J. M. S. (Manchester). <i>You will find, for a screen to use in the open
air, that the white cotton you refer to will be far too light. "Linsey
woolsey" forms an admirable screen, and by being left loose upon a
stretcher it may be looped up so as to form drapery, &amp;c. If you cannot
depend upon the collodion you purchase in your city, pray use your
ingenuity, and make some according to the formulary given in</i> Vol. vi.,
p. 277., <i>and you will be rewarded for your trouble.</i></p>


<p>C. E. F. <i>The various applications to your bath which you have used have
destroyed it in all probability past use. All solutions containing
silver will precipitate it in the form of a white powder, upon the
addition of common salt; and from this chloride the pure metal is again
readily obtained. The collodion of some makers always acts in the manner
you describe; and we have known it remedied by the addition of about one
drachm of spirits of wine to the ounce of collodion. Spirits of wine
also added to the nitrate bath&mdash;two drachms of spirits of wine to six
ounces of the aqueous solution&mdash;is sometimes very beneficial. When
collodion is inert, and the colour remains a pale milk and water blue
after the immersion, a few drops of saturated solution of iodide of
silver may be added, as it indicates a deficiency of the iodide. Should
the collodion then be turbid, a small lump of iodide of potassium may be
dropped into the bottle, which by agitation will soon effect a
clearance; when this is done, the fluid may be poured off from the
excess of iodide which remains undissolved.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alex. Rae</span> (Banff). <i>You shall have a private reply at our
earliest leisure. The questions you ask would almost comprise a Treatise
on Photography.</i></p>

<p>H. N. (March 30th). <i>1st. You will find the opacity you complain of
completely removed by the use of the amber varnish, as recommended by</i>
<span class="smcap">Dr. Diamond</span>, <i>unless it proceeds from light having acted
generally upon your sensitive collodion in the bath, or during the time
of its exposure in the camera; in which case there is no cure for
it.&mdash;2ndly. A greater intensity in negatives will be produced without
the nitric acid, but with an addition of more acetic acid the picture is
more brown and never so agreeable as a positive. 3rd. The protonitrate
of iron used pure produces a picture as delicate, and having all the
brilliancy of a Daguerreotype, without its unpleasant metallic
reflexion&mdash;the fine metal being deposited of a dead white; and combined
with the pyrogallic acid solution in the proportion of one part to six
or ten, produces pictures of a most agreeable ivory-like colour.&mdash;4th.
The protonitrate of iron, when mixed with the pyrogallic acid solution,
becomes of a fine violet blue; but after some minutes it darkens. It
should only be mixed immediately before using. The colour of the
protonitrate of iron will vary, even using the same chemicals. The cheap
nitrate of barytes of commerce answers exceedingly well in most cases;
but a finer silver surface is obtained by the use of the purified.&mdash;5th.
We have generally succeeded in obtaining portraits in an ordinary room,
the sitter being placed opposite and near the window: of course, a
glass-house is much better, the roof of which should be of violet glass,
ground on the inner side. This glass can be bought, made especially for
the purpose, at</i> 11d. <i>the square foot. It obstructs no chemical rays of
light, and is most pleasant to the eyes, causing no fatigue from the
great body of light admitted.</i></p>

24<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1847 he had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i>
3<i>d.</i>; but the profits being 2-1/4 per cent. per annum on the sum
insured (which is 22<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had
157<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums paid.</p>

<p>The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is
for Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the
Resident Director.</p>

<p>SYMPATHIES of the CONTINENT, or PROPOSALS for a NEW REFORMATION. By JOHN
BAPTIST VON HIRSCHER, D.D., Dean of the Metropolitan Church of Freiburg,
Breisgau, and Professor of Theology in the Roman Catholic University of
that City. Translated and edited with Notes and Introduction by the Rev.
ARTHUR CLEVELAND COXE, M.A., Rector of St. John's Church, Hartford,
Connecticut, U.S.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The following work will be found a noble apology for the
position assumed by the Church of England in the sixteenth
century, and for the practical reforms she then introduced into
her theology and worship. If the author is right, then the
changes he so eloquently urges upon the present attention of his
brethren ought to have been made <i>three hundred years ago</i>; and
the obstinate refusal of the Council of Trent to make such
reforms in conformity with Scripture and Antiquity, throws the
whole burthen of the sin of schism upon Rome, and not upon our
Reformers. The value of such admissions must, of course, depend
in a great measure upon the learning, the character, the
position, and the influence of the author from whom they
proceed. The writer believes, that questions as to these
particulars can be most satisfactorily answered."&mdash;<i>Introduction

<p>A MANUAL OF ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY, from the First to the Twelfth
Century inclusive. By the Rev. E. S. FOULKES, M.A., Fellow and Tutor of
Jesus College, Oxford.</p>

<blockquote><p>The main plan of the work has been borrowed from Spanheim, a
learned, though certainly not unbiassed, writer of the
seventeenth century: the matter compiled from Spondanus and
Spanheim, Mosheim and Fleury, Gieseler and D&ouml;llinger, and
others, who have been used too often to be specified, unless
when reference to them appeared desirable for the benefit of the
reader. Yet I believe I have never once trusted to them on a
point involving controversy, without examining their
authorities. The one object that I have had before me has been
to condense facts, without either garbling or omitting any that
should be noticed in a work like the present, and to give a fair
and impartial view of the whole state of the case.&mdash;<i>Preface.</i></p>

<p>"An epitomist of Church History has a task of no ordinary
greatness.... He must combine the rich faculties of condensation
and analysis, of judgment in the selection of materials, and
calmness in the expression of opinions, with that most excellent
gift of faith, so especially precious to Church historians,
which implies a love for the Catholic cause, a reverence for its
saintly champions, an abhorrence of the misdeeds which have
defiled it, and a confidence that its 'truth is great, and will
prevail.'</p>

<p>"And among other qualifications which may justly be attributed
to the author of the work before us, this last and highest is
particularly observable. He writes in a spirit of manly faith,
and is not afraid of facing 'the horrors and uncertainties,'
which, to use his own words, are to be found in Church
history."&mdash;<i>From the Scottish Ecclesiastical Journal, May,
1852.</i></p></blockquote>

and most of the Carpenter's terms in use at the period have been
introduced with authorities."&mdash;<i>Preface to the Fifth Edition.</i></p>
